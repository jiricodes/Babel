## Babel is an AI-driven speech-to-speech translator.

Our goal is to create something that will provide natural translations of content for businesses and education.

Babel uses AI-learning to mimic a foreign speaker's *voice* and speech patterns before translating the speaker to your native language. This way, you can focus on **what** is being said or shown on the screen rather than *reading* the subtitles.

## For businesses
- Reduces the friction and cost of onboarding new employees
- Increases your market size among non-native customers
- Stopgap solution or total replacement for hiring voice-over actors
- Automatic dubbing of content other than our current use-case
- Possible live translation in the future (streaming, conference calls, TV/radio, etc.)

## For schools
- Studies show that students learning in their native language..
  - Are more likely to engage with the material
  - Learn more efficiently
  - Perform with higher grades
- Good step towards a more accessible learning experience
