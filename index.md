## Babel is an AI-driven speech-to-speech translator.

Our goal is to create something that will provide natural translations of content for businesses and education.

Babel uses AI-learning to mimic a foreign speaker's *voice* and speech patterns before translating the speaker to your native language. This way, you can focus on **what** is being said or shown on the screen rather than *reading* the subtitles.

## For businesses
Babel reduces the friction and cost of onboarding new employees or your customers both natively and globally, by being able to support the orientation process without language barriers or time-consuming voice-overs.

## For schools
Many studies support the fact that students learn more efficiently, perform with higher grades, and are more likely to engage with their native language. Babel can be a good first step to providing a better and more accessible learning experience to your students.
